### Hi there 🙌🏼


I'm a web designer and developer who likes to build solutions to make people's life easier. 
I've been working as a web designer for sports brands (North Face, Head & Armada) and found a passion for code when I was wanted to automate my redundante tasks.
I believe strongly in modern web applications and Typescript has always been my primary language to build powerful application.

I've been working with: 

  - ReactJS ❤️
  - MongoDB & Firebase 
  - C# for Unity 🎮
  - HTML/CSS/JS 
  - SCSS
  - Tailswind
  - Material UI
  - GSAP 🧦
  - Framer Motion
